Changes made for SDSoC/reVISION support
========================================

The steps found in the Linux Boot Files section of UG1146 were followed to make the 
Linux system suitable for an SDSoC platform. In addition to these changes, the following changes were
also made:

1) Imported HDF found in hw_handoff using petalinux-config

2) Instead of modifying the bootargs in the petalinux-config menu, the system-user.dtsi file was modified to include "quiet".

3) Based on references in the ZCU102 revision platform, Instead of the xlnk device tree node cited in ug1146, the following was
   used (which puts the node in amba):

&amba {
	xlnk {
		compatible = "xlnx,xlnk-1.0";
	};
};

4) Changed the CMA size to 256 MB using petalinux-config -c kernel 

5) Used petalinux-config -c rootfs to enable the following packages:

	misc->packagegroup-core-buildessential
	misc->packagegroup-petalinux-opencv
	misc->gdb->gdbserver
	console->utils->file->file
	console->utils->strace->strace
	misc->valgrind

6) Including opencv and the other rootfs libraries causes the ramdisk size to increase to >128MB. Booting with a ramdisk this large 
   is not currently working, so we had to switch to SD rootfs. This has other benefits, including additional available system memory,
   persistent modifications, and increased system performance in some scenarios. The main cost of this is added complexity to the SD
   card preparation, because the image has to be flashed onto the SD card. 

   The idea that this issue is caused by the rootfs being larger than 128MB compressed is speculation, another possibility is that 
   this is being caused by the existence of some hard links present in the opencv packages that are incompatible with the cpio 
   compression used with the initramdisk. 

   That was the explanation, the how is as follows: used petalinux-config to change Root Filesystem type to "SD Card" as described in
   the petalinux README.md, being careful not to remove "quiet" from the bootargs in the device tree.

   root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait
